# houston-language-explorer

This web map uses data collected for the American Community Survey (5-year, 2015) to visualize the languages spoken at home in the greater Houston area using the Leaflet JavaScript library.

## Motivation
Originally done as a test of Leaflet's capabilities visualizing census data, it eventually became a fully functioning web map. I tried to keep the script as "templated" as possible so that it can be used for any other census data and geographies.

Names and order of languages are based on the the American Community Survey. I apologize in advance for "Other African Languages" and other offensive categories... You can read more about the logic behind the categories of languages at the [US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/topics/population/language-use/about.html).

Partially inspired by Jill Hubley's [Languages of NYC](https://www.jillhubley.com/project/nyclanguages).
